    "## 4) Training an Initial Machine learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now we will train our first machine learning model.\n",
    "* In this we are going to use \"Random Forest Classifier\" So random forests work by training a bunch of individual decision trees with randomized parameters and then averaging the results from those decision trees so because of these process random forest are resistant to overfitting they can overfit but it's harder for them to overfit than it is for other models to overfit they also run relatively quickly and they can pick up the non linear tendencies in the data\n",
    "* So we are going to initialize our model and we are going to pass in a few parameters so \"n\" estimator is the number of individual decision trees we want to train the higher this is generally the better your accuracy is up up to a limit. And we setting this to be 100\n",
    "* \"min samples\" split help us to protect against overfitting decision tree have a tendency to overfit if they build the tree too deeply. The higher we set it the less accurate the model will be but the less it will overfit \n",
    "* Next we are going to set random state equal to 1. So a random forest as you may have guessed has some randomization built in so setting a random state means that if we run the same model twice the random number is going to generated will be in a predictable sequence each time using this random seed of one so if we rerun the model twice we will get the same results which helps if you are updating or improving your model and you want to make sure it's actually the model or the something you did that improved error versus just something random.\n",
    "* We are going to split our data up into a train and test set now this is time series data and with time series data you can't use cross validation or you can but if you do then your result will look amazing when you are training and horrible in real world and the reason why if you use cross validation or another way to split up your training and test set that doesn't take the time series nature of the data into account you will be using future data to predict the past which you just can't do in the real world and will result in something called leakage where you are leaking information into the model\n",
    "* So the way we are going to split this data set up is we are going to put all of the rows except the last hundred rows into the training set and we are going to put the last hundred rows into the test set\n",
    "* And then we going to create a list with all of the columns that we are going to use to predict the target. So in this we are going to close, volume, open, high, and low so those are going to be our predictors.\n",
    "* And then we are going to fit the model \"model.fit\" train predictor so this using these predictor columns and then we are going to try to predict the target. "

    "* So let's update our model slightly and change some of our parameters.\n",
    "* so we will increase our number of estimator to 200 and we will reduce our min sample split to 50.\n",
    "* In this we are predict proba method and what this will return is actually a probability that the row will be zero or one.\n",
    "* So to return the probability that the stock price will go down tomorrow and the probability of the stock price will go up tomorrow.\n",
    "* So what we can do is just get the second column of this which will be the probability the stock price goes up.\n",
    "* Then we have to set our custom threshold so by default the threshold is 0.5 so if there's greater than a 50 chance that the price will go up the model will return that the price will go up. We are going to set that threshold to 60 so this means that the model has to be more confident the price will go up in order to actually show that the price will go up. And what this will do will reduce the total number of trading days so it will reduce the number of days that it predicts the price will go up but it will increase the chance that the price will actually go up on those days which fits really well with what we want right."
